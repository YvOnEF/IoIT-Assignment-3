                    <p>Hi, my name is Yifan Shen, Yvon is my English name. I am from Shanghai, an international metropolis
                        located in the middle of the eastern coastline of China. Chinese is my native language. I have been
                        in Melbourne for about three years. Throughout high school, because of my strong interest in IT, I
                        have studied Applied Computing and Software Development. Computers have always given me a platform
                        to demonstrate my creativity and increase my general knowledge. For my previous coursework, I
                        designed a project plan which related to the COVID-19 drone monitoring in Applied Computing and made
                        a program which I called it for "Filter Bubble" in Software Development. This gave me a great number
                        of experiences in IT. In my spare time, I sometimes create some small programs, testing out new
                        functions or combining old features which provides me a good opportunity to see my progress as a
                        software developer. The major for further education that I pursue here in RMIT is Information
                        Technology. In my leisure time, I have a great number of hobbies. Playing the piano can be one of
                        them. Doing sports is also an integral part of my life. In my spare time, I love road-bike cycling.
                        During the ride, I can not only relax my mind, exercise my body, but also enjoy the beautiful
                        scenery along the way. I also enjoy playing tennis, basketball and badminton. Collecting things is
                        also one of my favourite hobbies, ranging from sneakers, Pokémon cards, coins, stamps, etc. My
                        most-liked thing to do on vocations is to travel. It is undoubtedly a fantastic thing to go and see
                        where you want to go, photographing and discover the beauty of the earth. The place I most look
                        forward to is Antarctica. For photography, for adventure, for icebergs, for wildlife, for another
                        world…

                        Greetings, my name is Roy Loh. I am a Malaysian Chinese international student studying information
                        technology in RMIT university. I completed my WACE exams in 2020 but took a gap year due to Covid. I
                        can speak English and mandarin. I enjoy watching videos on computer setups I cannot afford on the
                        internet and anime in my free time. I work casually as a coffee barista at a hotel. As an
                        international student in Melbourne, I find it quite challenging due to it being a new environment,
                        however I am slowly getting used to the culture here. I dream to earn enough money so I can travel
                        around the world. I aspire to work in the technology industry in the future and I hope to learn
                        useful skills such as programming and broaden my knowledge regarding the world of tech.

                    <p>
                        Hello I'm Michael Khalil, I'm currently 18 years of age as of 2022 and just finished highschool last
                        year completing VCE. As of this year I am currently enrolled at RMIT Melbourne studying my first
                        year for my Bachelor of Information technology degree. I was born here in Australia but both sides
                        of my family came from Egypt, with both my parents moving from Egypt to Melbourne as migrants.
                        Because of my constant exposure to Egyptian culture and the Arabic language, I understand spoken
                        Arabic vaguely (but cant read it!) and can barely speak it. Through primary and high school I also
                        know basic Italian. My hobbies and interests include, Video Games, computer hardware, IT as a whole,
                        japanese cars and modifying them, as well as motorsports in general (especially Formula 1!), and
                        even a bit of anime.

                        last year, and currently studying at Rmit Bachelor of IT. I was born and raised in tonga, an island
                        located to the east side of Australia, close to New zealand. Tonga is a beautiful island surrounded
                        with white beaches and coral reefs and covered with tropical rainforests. Although I was born in
                        tonga, both my parents are chinese therefore I am from the nationality of China. The language that
                        we speak at home is Mandarin no matter whether our family is in Tonga or Australia. My hobbies and
                        interests are actually playing basketball and watching the nba, video games and sneakers.

                    <h3>Aims</h3>
                    Our concept is a smartphone application that functions as a virtual wallet, serving as a central
                    location for all types of virtual cards, QR codes, and virtual tickets. As there are many different 
                    types of services that can store credit cards (e.g., apple pay and google play), and some less 
                    popular virtual cards and/or QR Codes used in other non wallet apps may require a different 
                    application or may not even be obtainable on a virtual wallet service, a user may need various 
                    applications and accounts to use any of their virtual cards on their phone. Our aim is to provide
                    a functioning mobile application that integrates the use of near field communication (NFC) with
                    Card / QR storage in order to essentially provide users with a unified “eWallet” making a card 
                    holder’s life easier and more efficient when dealing with scannable items on their phone, with the
                    use of this application, our biggest target to achieve would be to create a functioning ewallet that 
                    allows for a convenient and straightforward experience for all users. 

                    A goal that will assist us in achieving our aim would be for large institutions and banks to combine
                    their cards with our application, this could mean that banking customers would no longer require 
                    physical cards but instead their bank cards would be immediately incorporated into our application, 
                    This is also true for any card producer such as ptv, arcades, universities, gyms etc. This feature,
                    if achieved, could contribute greatly to adding more convenience for the users, thus allowing us to
                    further our progression towards our aim.

                    Another goal that can help the team in achieving our aims is for system wide integration of our
                    Application within a tech company with influence, such as Apple or Android. With the addition of 
                    our application with their operating systems, these companies can soar our teams efforts in broadening
                    The user base of our application. With the introduction of an increase in users utilizing the ewallet,
                    More user feedback can be received which will allow for more accurate changes to be made to better
                    Suit the users needs and requirements, more features will be able to be added 
                    as well as user requests
                    Would flood in. this will not only allow for a more widespread deployment of our app, But also allows
                    for us to partner with those corporations and continue developing the software and hardware to 
                    allow for a greater user experience whilst using our app.

                        Cloud services are web based platforms, software and infrastructure that are hosted by third party
                        providers such as Azure cloud or AWS, and made available to be used throughout the internet by
                        individuals, businesses and organisations.
                        Cloud computing enables businesses and individuals to consume resources online, such as databases,
                        storage, memory, data transfer, virtual machines and pay-as-you-go.
                        Cloud computing is a major improvement over traditional computing. Unlike traditional computing
                        where regular maintenance is needed which will result in IT labour costs, cloud service providers
                        will provide maintainability and automatic updates to new databases, OS and softwares, to ensure
                        everything is up to date.
                        Cloud service providers will also ensure data is secured. This allows businesses to cut operational
                        costs, such as less hardware, databases, software licences and servers.
                        Cloud computing models also improve upon older ones, for example a pay-as-you-go model charges for
                        resources as they are being used. Monthly usage is tracked, and the user only has to pay for used
                        resources.
                        Cloud computing is scalable and reliable. There is an unlimited number of resources that can be
                        utilised by users. Processing of resources increases based on users' needs, the user can always
                        scale down if resources are not needed.
                        Cloud services are also managed by service providers meaning that it can be accessed 24/7, therefore
                        the business and organisation does not have to worry about maintaining the servers, thus cutting
                        costs of labour to maintain their hardware.
                        Cloud service providers have multiple data centres located throughout the world, which make them
                        faster and more reliable. AWS is currently leading the world with the largest global footprint, with
                        86 availability zones throughout 26 regions.
                        Cloud computing can be divided into three major categories, Infrastructure as a service(Iaas),
                        platform as a service(Paas) and software as a service(Saas). Majority of the top cloud service
                        providers provide all these 3 services. An entire IT computing infrastructure is offered by Iaas,
                        which will be provisioned and managed over the internet. The key components of Iaas are used to
                        replace existing development and test environments, virtual machines, website hosting, storage,
                        networking, servers, backup, applications and data, middleware and high performance computing. Paas
                        provides a full development and deployment environment in the cloud, which includes debugging,
                        deployment tools and services, testing and dev. Saas is when someone else develops and hosts a
                        software, and this software is later used by businesses or individuals when they need to do so.
                        Future of cloud:
                        Increase storage capacity - With the high volume of incoming data, it will be difficult for
                        businesses to store data securely. Therefore the demand for cloud computing will be increasing
                        drastically with many businesses adopting cloud computing. Cloud service providers will compete
                        among one another to provide larger data centres at lower prices, and companies will be able to
                        store large amounts of data securely.
                        Increased security - Data stored in the cloud is secure, but not entirely. Some companies which
                        provide cloud services take security for granted. Large amounts of data often attract cyber
                        criminals, therefore in the future, cloud service providers are likely to provide better security
                        measures to prevent cyberattacks.
                        Modular software will be a priority - Programs are becoming increasingly complex, and the size of
                        programs are also bigger than before, therefore advanced system thinking will soon be needed in
                        cloud technology. We can see software being developed in various angles because in the future,
                        applications will be stored not only in the cloud but in other places as well. The application will
                        be stored on different modules of the servers located on different clouds. Service companies are
                        currently using various types of software which have yet to be modified, which leads to the fact
                        that modified software which is required in cloud computing tol provide better and improved security
                        and facilities. This software will be more user friendly and flexible towards end users. This
                        software will be advantageous towards the company as it will be both cost and time efficient.
                        Over the years, cloud computing has moved from an innovative concept to a booming industry. In 1969,
                        a computer scientist named J.C.R. Licklider proposed a concept of interconnected computer systems of
                        computers, which was later developed into the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network(ARPANET), a
                        predecessor of the internet. ARPANET was the first network that enabled the sharing of digital data
                        between computers remotely. During the following decades, many advancements happened such as IBM’s
                        virtual machine operating system, which enables the creation of a computer virtually, which can then
                        be operated like a real computer physically. Other popular hardware virtualization platforms
                        included tools like Vagrant and parallels for Mac would appear along the way, and eventually virtual
                        private networks would be created for business purposes leading to the development of modern cloud
                        computing infrastructure. Salesforce became the first company that offered software-as-a-service,
                        and thus the era of cloud computing was born.

                        Cloud has provided new ways of accessing data cost efficiently and quickly, and allowed companies to
                        boost innovation and leverage new technologies as they are invented and modified. Cloud has
                        redefined how technology is embedded in everything we do, and changed the way it is built and
                        delivered. However, the rise of cloud has also brought multiple social concerns, including:
                        Ethics in cloud - Data is essential for business decisions, however there are ethical concerns
                        surrounding consumer data stored in cloud repositories that are being analysed by service providers.
                        There are inevitable privacy and security concerns regarding how the data is used, especially when
                        there is a desire to provide customised services. When a machine learning model makes a decision,
                        they might reflect and even exaggerate biases of the developers of the system, causing negative
                        consequences to affected consumers.
                        Digital divide - A gap will be formed between those with access and those without access to
                        technology, the concept of a digital divide was first formed when the iPhone penetrated into the
                        smartphone market, and as the years passed, technology continued to grow and evolve while leaving
                        those without skills behind. As cloud based technologies continue to improve and grow, workers in
                        the ever growing IT industry are required to learn new skills or learn new roles. Business
                        organisations are required to provide proper training programs to reskill workers. Google and Amazon
                        provide certificates for people to broaden their skills to take a step closer into becoming a cloud
                        practitioner.
                        Uneven playing field - The increase in cloud computing has lowered barriers of entry for businesses
                        and allowed efficiency and lower cost benefits. However, with the growth of large cloud companies
                        such as AWS, Google and Azure, companies may need to consider non-traditional ecosystem
                        relationships. These large cloud companies have the most data and resources, their growth will cause
                        them to continue dominating the market, and eventually the question will arise whether cloud-enabled
                        technologies will be a democratising force or will create an oligopolistic or monopolistic society.
                        Opportunities
                        Due to the increase in demand for cloud computing, the global cloud computing market is likely to
                        surpass $1 trillion by 2024. The revenue of Amazon web services(AWS), the largest cloud service
                        provider alone, expanded from 44 billion US dollars in 2020, and is expected to reach 62 billion US
                        dollars the following year. AWS has also announced nine more availability zones and three more
                        regions. This creates more job opportunities for cloud engineers and cloud architects who are
                        responsible for designing and maintaining the cloud architecture and solutions architects who are
                        responsible for aiding customers in implementing cloud technologies in their businesses. Companies
                        like AWS and Google provide certificates, which is a more cost efficient alternative compared to a
                        degree which requires a lot more time and money.

                        The evolution of cloud computing is beneficial towards me in my daily life. As a student, I need to
                        store many files and documents. Therefore the use of cloud is beneficial as it is cost efficient.
                        Purchasing physical storage on a laptop is expensive for many students, therefore I think the use of
                        cloud storage is beneficial and cost efficient for us. The use of cloud in shopping websites is
                        convenient for me, for example there is a ‘recently used’ option, which is a direct result from
                        cloud services. As a broke indecisive student, this is very convenient for me to keep track and
                        compare multiple products across websites. Even the use of navigation apps cause me to indirectly
                        use cloud, as navigation apps like google maps use cloud navigation to ensure the maps and direction
                        displayed are up to date via a network connection. This is especially helpful towards an
                        international student like myself in melbourne as I still get lost navigating through the city.
                        Online cloud based software such as Microsoft Teams, which is currently being used by my group mates
                        and I to communicate for team meetings, or even discord, which is used by my friends and I to
                        communicate with each other when playing games. Without these cloud based applications, I would be
                        unable to communicate with my friends for my assignments and when playing games. Social media apps
                        like facebook and instagram also utilise cloud to store pictures and data. Social media is a big
                        part of my everyday life, and of many others too I’m sure. All this is possible due to the usage of
                        cloud computing. However, for the older members of my family and of many others, they are unlikely
                        to transition to using cloud technologies for storage purposes, due to their lack of knowledge and
                        unwillingness to transition from something they’re comfortable with.

                    <h2>Robots</h2>
                    <img src="robot.jpg" alt='Robot' height='500px'>
                    <p>
                        Robots are machines that are programmed by computers to perform a series of actions automatically.
                        It can replicate a human being and is able to mimic human movement and functions automatically. But
                        cannot think and have emotions like us, humans, as of now. This is likely to be a function in the
                        future as researchers and developers are essentially updating and upgrading robots to more resemble
                        humans as time goes on.
                        Robots are diverse. Various robots can have two, four, six, or more legs, some are sizes of a coin
                        and some bigger than a car . Some robots are able to make pancakes, while some can fly in the sky,
                        and others that are capable of landing on Mars. Some robots help hospitals do surgeries and prepare
                        prescription medicines for patients, and others toiling away in dirty factories.
                        This is all thanks to computer programming and robotics software; these are two major factors that
                        allow a robot to be automated. Through the use of algorithms and artificial intelligence, a robot is
                        able to accomplish what it’s accomplished in the years of its existence.
                        Robots are capable of performing actions that humans can and cannot perform such as:
                        Cooking- It can choose recipes from a programmed library, and through the automated actions of
                        measuring, mixing the ingredients, baking broiling, simmering and stirring the meal,
                        Running- A robot can easily outrun a human being as robots have the ability to store and charge its
                        energy efficiently and use that power effectively. A technical cheetah built by and engineer at MIT
                        is topped with a speed of 30m.p.h, this machines is used to help with recusing activities in areas
                        where the surface isn’t ideal for wheeled robots
                        Fly- Drones are a type of robot too, it can fly anywhere it wants and it’s can be responsible to
                        monitor areas where humans cannot physically go to, or it can be a device of delivering goods such
                        as packages to people in less than 30 minutes
                        preparing medications for patients- There are nurse bots operating in the backend of hospitals and
                        pharmacies to locate and grab the medicines. Robots can ensure the productivity in the hospitals as
                        robotics, generally saying minimises error while being extremely fast.
                        Make deliveries - Robots can deliver anything from packages to online orders, plus room services and
                        food in restaurants which minimises human resources which allows businesses to save tons of money
                        And some that can perform surgeries- Some hospitals and medical facilities are using robots to
                        assist with their surgery operations, as using robotic assistance gives “more precision,
                        flexibility, and control than is possible with conventional techniques”.
                        Generally speaking these robots perform somewhat basic tasks and some are required to be controlled
                        by human actions. But in the future this is likely to change, through the use of AI limited
                        memories, theory of mind and self-aware AI. AI limited memories is where the machine can store
                        existing data and create better outputs by using the data. For example, Tesla's self-driving car
                        where it can observe the speed of the car and direction and act accordingly. Theory of mind, this is
                        the technology where AI can connect with human thoughts and understand human thoughts and emotions
                        and where this can be embedded into the robot or machine. Self-aware AI, this is the type of AI in
                        the future. This is the AI where they have independent intelligence, and will make their own
                        decision. These machines “will be smarter than the human mind”. With these technologies, robotic
                        intelligence will perform more like a human being in the future where it not only acts and moves
                        like a human but it is also able to think and have emotions like a human.

                        Robots are likely to take over 40 percent of our jobs in the next 15 years. AI and robotics will
                        become smarter, and machines will be more humanised in the future. Hence this might make a lot of
                        jobs redundant. This only works in the favour of businesses as implementing robotic operations into
                        the business not only cuts the expense of wage but also increases the productivity of the business,
                        because generally speaking machines are less like to have human errors and businesses don't have to
                        spend time and money to make employees happy as machines and robots doesn't have feelings and
                        emotions, so this only works in the favour of business owners. For employees this is bad news for
                        them as their jobs will most likely be replaced by AIs and robots, research shows that 86% of HR
                        professionals admit it is possible for their jobs to be replaced by AI in the future, with 28% of
                        them thinking the chance is highly likely. The people that are most affected are those in the
                        industries of
                        Automotive, beverage, computers, consumer goods, e-commerce, electronics, and food exact jobs that
                        are likely to be replaced by AI are; couriers/delivery people, doctors, accountants, security guards
                        and taxi and bus drivers. These are the industries that are likely to be replaced by AI and robots
                        in the future. However, automations provide the opportunity for humans to focus on higher skilled,
                        higher quality and higher paid tasks. Therefore this may also create jobs and opportunities for us,
                        jobs such as robot maintenance and creation could be created. This also creates a positive impact on
                        labor demand and wages, as for the fear of being unemployed, this can overall increase the quality
                        of the economy as people are trying to be better and better to not get eliminated by robots and AI.

                        Robots and Ai currently have a pretty small impact on my daily life as of now, but this is likely to
                        change in the future, when I step into the workforce. It impacts me now in the convenience of my
                        life. For example, we have a self-cleaning device at home where it can detect dirty spots in the
                        room and avoid any objects in front of it. This saves me and the family time and effort to clean the
                        house where we could be doing other stuff. Recently i've been to a restaurant where my food was
                        served with a robotic machine, in my opinion it wasn't as effective as a human waitress because it
                        would often run into walls and other people's chairs, this is due to the AI technology not yet
                        mature. As I said, robots can create convenience for all humankind, for my family and friends where
                        they are super busy so they can build a smart home where they can control the cleaning, cooking and
                        laundry of the house. Despite the convenience of robots, it could also bring unpleasant factors for
                        my family and friends as during the years or in the future some of their jobs could be replaced by
                        robot, and they could have difficult time finding new jobs as they dont have the time or the ability
                        to study and move into another industry of jobs.
                        Not only is it effective but it is also efficient in areas of operation for businesses. This is a
                        major factor I will have to consider in the future of my life as I wouldn't study or prepare to work
                        in the areas or industries where robotics are likely to replace. Therefore i wouldn't consider
                        stepping into the jobs similar to couriers/delivery people, doctors, accountants, security guards
                        and taxi and bus drivers as listed above.

                    <h2>Blockchain & Crypto</h2>
                    <img src="bitcoin.jpg" alt='Bitcoin' height='300px'>
                    <p>
                        According to IBM. “Blockchain is a shared, immutable ledger that facilitates the process of
                        recording transactions and tracking assets in a business network. An asset can be tangible (a house,
                        car, cash, land) or intangible (intellectual property, patents, copyrights, branding). Virtually
                        anything of value can be tracked and traded on a blockchain network, reducing risk and cutting costs
                        for all involved.”

                        The innovation of Blockchain technologies is important and significant because it provides
                        immediate, shared and completely transparent information stored on an untamperable ledger that can
                        only be accessed through permitted network members. This technology is superior to storing
                        information and transactions on a server as it is more secure and more efficient as servers can be
                        directly attacked to gain unauthorised access to tamper, destroy or steal data.

                        When a transaction occurs it is stored as a “block” of data and can store a wide variety of data.
                        This block is connected to the blocks before it and the blocks that will come after it forming a
                        “chain”. These blocks link securely to prevent modifications and blocks being added in between in
                        the chain. As the chain increases in size, the blocks that are added make the entire chain more
                        secure and greatly reduces the chances that the blockchain becomes maliciously tampred

                        Cryptocurrency is a form of digital currency that uses blockchain technology to allow for it to be
                        decentralised, not requiring banks or governments to control or manage it. This is because everyone
                        has access to the same ledger and information that cannot be altered making it a secure means for
                        transactions.

                        In terms of blockchain, having an immutable ledger means that data and transactions can be stored
                        securely without being modified and can be stored privately through private blockchain networks.
                        Blockchain technology is being used for quick money transfers without the need of a bank. In the
                        near future we could see much more widespread adoption and is also in use for supply chains to
                        quickly pinpoint items and figure out inefficiencies in the supply chain. There are many other
                        potential use cases for blockchains in many different industries such as; Businesses, for higher
                        profits and lower costs to operate while also being more efficient.

                        In terms of cryptocurrency, as its name states, its use as a currency has only become more and more
                        popular since its inception and is becoming more accepted and used like a legitimate currency as
                        time goes on. However since it is a new technology, it is not widespread as a traditional means of
                        currency and not used everywhere and its volatility makes it more attractive as an investment
                        opportunity rather than a primary means of currency. However we are already seeing governments and
                        other organisations push the idea to regulate cryptocurrency to make it a more legitimate and stable
                        currency and prevent it being used for fraudulent activities. Within the near future we could see
                        regulations and governments passing bills that make cryptocurrency a widely accepted form of
                        currency exchange internationally and domestically , increasing its adoption and use. However,
                        because of the potential that crypto can become more regulated, its volatility may diminish and as a
                        result it may not be as attractive as an investment option

                        Ben Mann from Development Alternatives Incorporated (DAI), an expert in the exploration of the
                        applications of blockchain states, “Bitcoin is the one solid, mostly-undisputed success story of
                        blockchain”, however he also states that “there are lots of obstacles to come (with blockchain
                        development), but I am hopeful that it can serve a purpose”. Mann elaborates and states that
                        applications of blockchain are very resource intensive and most probably won't work in countries
                        “where the government frequently shuts down the internet, where there is civil unrest, or poor
                        energy infrastructure”. Despite these drawbacks there are potential beneficial impacts of blockchain
                        if developed. If viable, Blockchain technologies could replace current systems in businesses, banks,
                        legal institutions, government systems and many other potential applications such as real estate.
                        This will affect people doing any sort of meaningful transaction in a business/organisation
                        perspective, instead of transactions and other information being stored on a server or even paper in
                        some cases, it can be stored quickly and securely on a blockchain that is less likely to be
                        corruptible or destroyed than other methods. This will create, replace and make redundant
                        technologies and jobs. In terms of jobs, if blockchain is seen as more effective than servers and
                        databases, database and server managers and maintainers might get replaced with blockchain
                        developers. Some banking jobs might become redundant as transfers and other services can be stored
                        entirely on the blockchain. The most likely technology that blockchains will challenge but most
                        probably not replace are servers and databases. Databases are a more cost effective and less
                        resource intensive way to store data in comparison to blockchain.

                        In terms of cryptocurrency, this will most likely have an effect on businesses, banks and
                        governments if crypto currency becomes a more dominant and more adopted type of currency,
                        traditional domestic currency may compete or even be replaced by cryptocurrency, encouraging
                        businesses, banks and governments to change their processes and the jobs they supply to facilitate
                        this greater adoption.



                        If Blockchain and cryptocurrency become much more prevalent and dominant in my time, a lot of my day
                        to day life would change because of it. Many financial related interactions may use blockchain
                        technology and these transactions/interactions may even be surrounding cryptocurrency. Many other
                        businesses and services that I will interact with such as postage tracking, legal services, real
                        estate, and many other services may use blockchain technology to securely track, store data and
                        transactions. Instead of transactions with domestic currency I may be paying with a cryptocurrency
                        or potentially many different types of cryptocurrency. Instead of tracking items to be delivered
                        from a website linked to a server, the tracking might use blockchain technology instead. Written
                        forms and documents might be completely replaced with blocks of data storing the same information on
                        a secure private blockchain. Family and friends may be able to manage real estate that they own much
                        more efficiently since information can be stored on a blockchain rather than a collection of
                        documents. Identity and information theft can also be reduced since documents can be completely
                        digital and secure through blockchain. However in some cases a complete changeover to blockchain
                        technology may not be ideal for less tech savvy individuals who prefer physical documents.

                    <h2>Autonomous Vehicles</h2>
                    <img src="Teslamodel3.jpg" alt='teslamodel3' height='500px'>
                    <p>Autonomous vehicles, also known as unmanned vehicles, computer-driven vehicles, or wheeled mobile
                        robots, are intelligent vehicles that realise unmanned driving through computer systems.
                        Self-driving cars rely on artificial intelligence, visual computing, radar, surveillance devices,
                        and global positioning systems to work together to allow computers to operate motor vehicles
                        autonomously and safely without any human intervention.
                        The rationale for a sustainable transport environment comes from political and economic will and the
                        rapid introduction of information and communication technologies into passenger vehicles. The
                        motivating factors for vehicles being built with intelligent capabilities are laid out initially. A
                        description of the navigation problem is given to understand the functions needed for a vehicle to
                        navigate autonomously. To give an overall perspective on how technology is converging towards
                        vehicles with autonomous capabilities, advances have been classified into driver-centric,
                        network-centric and vehicle-centric. Vehicle manufacturers are introducing Advanced Driving
                        Assistance Systems (ADAS) at a rapid pace; these are Driver Centric systems that facilitate driver
                        awareness. This has led to the introduction of traffic sensors that can be used in situations, and
                        technologies that are advancing from simple to more controllable.
                        At present, the development trend of the global driverless car industry is good, but there are few
                        areas where mass production has been put into use. Autonomous driving technology, 5G communication
                        technology and related technologies of new energy vehicles will develop together. International
                        leading institutions are suspected of completing the research and development of driverless cars and
                        entering the trial operation and commissioning stage. Most domestic companies developing driverless
                        cars are now in the experimental stage, that is, the development of the industry is in its infancy.
                        With the continuous maturity of driverless technology and the introduction and adjustment of
                        government policies, driverless vehicles are expected to be used first in industrial development,
                        then in the commercial field, and finally in civilian use. It is expected that around 2035, the
                        global driverless car will gradually replace the traditional car and enter the explosive stage of
                        sales.
                        The widespread use of driverless cars would reduce traffic accidents and the economic costs that
                        result from them. The autonomous vehicles will be able to use their efficient driving to save on
                        energy costs. The potential economic benefit from this project is huge. There will also be some
                        unintended consequences of autonomous vehicles. </p>
                    <p>First, some people may become unemployed. When cars, trucks and buses start themselves, people who
                        earn their living driving these vehicles will suddenly find themselves out of a job. The U.S. Bureau
                        of Labour Statistics reports that in 2019, there were over 2,000,000 people employed as
                        tractor-trailer truck drivers. There's a huge amount of people to be employed as taxi drivers and
                        bus drivers. The combined effect would result in the loss of more than 2.9 million jobs, which is
                        more than the number of jobs lost during the 2008 recession. The number of jobs lost due to the
                        obesity epidemic rises to 4.5 million when you include delivery and light truck drivers. There are a
                        lot of people who work in roles related to driving, so the number of people who work in these
                        positions could increase.</p>
                    <p>Secondly, hackers may take over the vehicles. In the past, security experts have been able to exploit
                        flaws in modern automobiles and take control of them. A driverless car would be entirely controlled
                        by computer hardware and software, making it immune to these kinds of attacks. A malicious attacker
                        could find and exploit security holes in any number of complex systems to take over a car or cause
                        it to crash. In addition, future autonomous vehicles may be networked to communicate with each other
                        and send and receive data about other vehicles on the road. If an attack were to occur on an
                        autonomous vehicle network, it could cause all of the cars on the road to stop working.</p>
                    <p>Thirdly, autonomous vehicles may cause some people to get Car Sickness. Some passengers in
                        self-driving cars may experience motion sickness, causing nausea and even vomiting. Motion sickness
                        tends to become more severe if people feel bored and do the activities, such as reading and playing
                        games.</p>
                    <p>For me, the effect of autonomous driving is, if I live far from my place of work or the place I would
                        like to go and use autonomous vehicles, I may be able to avoid having to commute. It will be more
                        acceptable since the time usually spent driving can be spent on more productive activities, like
                        reading, sleeping, or simply relaxing. Self-driving cars reduce the need for drunk driving lawyers,
                        as some people in daily life do not face the pressure of driving when a drunk and tired person can
                        sleep in the backseat. Their self-driving cars will bring them home. This will have a significant
                        impact on road accidents and the probability of a traffic accident will be greatly reduced.
                        Autonomous driving can reduce transport energy consumption by up to 90% which could lead to
                        substantial reductions in pollution and emissions in our life. And it will also improve the
                        transport interconnectivity.</p>

                    <h2>Front End Developer</h2>
                    <p>For the day-to-day activity for front-end developers, they usually create more than 3 prototypes of a website, these websites are not totally different, only a few differences in the design, then doing A/B test, they put the different designs of websites on the domain, using google analytics to track user behaviour to figure out which one performs the best. the performance. after finishing the coding of the UX part of the website, they also need to test if the website is supported by most of the browsers. Front-end developer always works in a team, knowing how to express their ideas and opinions in the team are essential. even though they are only responsible for the user interface and user experience. While designing the website, they need to frequently communicate with the back-end developer.
they spend most of their time developing the prototype and interpreting with some users to get real-world insight from users' behaviour.
The most challenging part about this work for this position is communication with the back-end developer. because sometimes it is very hard to use the current technology to achieve all the functionalities that are being demonstrated in the protepyte, in this case, even if they have very good idea of deign, they still need to find best solution to get best result by communicating with developers.

                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>
                        Our project is a mobile application that is essentially a virtual wallet designed to be a unified
                        hub for all forms of virtual cards, QR codes and virtual tickets. This idea can be innovative
                        because there are many different types of services that can store credit cards (eg: apple pay and
                        google play), and some less popular virtual cards and/or QR Codes used in other non wallet apps may
                        use a different application or not even be available on a virtual wallet service, meaning a user
                        might need multiple applications and multiple accounts to use all their virtual cards on their
                        phone. This application will be designed so that all these cards and scannable codes and items can
                        be stored in one place, as a unified “eWallet”, making a card holder’s life easier and more
                        efficient when dealing with scannable items on their phone.

                    <h2>Motivation</h2>
                    <p>This idea has come from personal experiences, with statistics and global trends making this idea more
                        viable. When I make cashless payments, the majority of those transactions are made through Apple pay
                        which I find to be much more convenient than taking out my physical wallet. The only time I need to
                        regularly take out my wallet is when taking public transport to touch on and off my miki, which for
                        me personally is a mild inconvenience when we already have these technologies in place in our phones
                        through near field communication (NFC). Although a miki can be stored on mobile through google pay,
                        the initial inconvenience still stands, having multiple wallet/card applications can be less
                        efficient and convenient than a simple physical wallet! Especially when we are moving into a more
                        digitised society
                        The solution is simple, people can have all their physical cards stored in one wallet, so all that
                        is needed is one application to store everything, not multiple applications. This idea of
                        convenience and practicality is the key motivation for my project. Data proves that this type of
                        technology is becoming increasingly popular, with virtual wallets becoming increasingly more
                        adopted. With 900 million transactions at the start of the pandemic increasing to almost 1.5 billion
                        in 2021, a 25% increase, which is set to go above 33% in the coming years. The growth has been so
                        large in fact that 45% of all eCommerce transactions were through mobile in 2021, which is twice as
                        large as the payments done via debit cards and three times of debit card payments.

                    <h2>Description</h2>
                    <p>The application would have a simple and easy to navigate UI so that a user can access all their items
                        quickly. There will be a variety of features and connections to allow for the maximum amount of
                        cards and scanables as possible, while also making this experience to add them in the app as simple
                        as efficient as possible for the user.
                        The types of cards, scanables and their connections to the application can be separated into
                        classifications that I have designated and can be either “locally stored” and “redirected”. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Locally stored items means that information is stored directly on the application, which is the most
                        desired form of storage for efficient use, in comparison to redirected items. Redirected items is
                        the less ideal method to access items, this is where the app cannot support the type of item, and
                        must redirect to another application which does.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h3>Internally Supported NFC (locally stored)</h3>
                    <p>When debit card is located in the app and can be used without exiting the application, and can send a
                        signal through the phone's NFC for a successful transaction, this type of card can be called an
                        “internally supported NFC”, in most cases large institution/banks eventually will officially support
                        the card being used in the app as they already do with other major wallets like apple wallet and
                        google pay. This type of classification not only applies to bank cards, but also one time codes and
                        other scannable codes (eg: loyalty reward card and limited time offers) that may be officially
                        supported by the institution to work in the virtual wallet.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>User Inserted Scannable Cards (locally stored)</h3>
                    <p>If a scannable item isn't supported by the institution, then the user can take a photo or screenshot
                        of QR code or other scannable item that does not send a signal and then save it in the wallet,
                        making it so that the code can still be scanned in the app without redirecting to another app or
                        even referring to a physical voucher/docket that may have been given to them. This won't be able to
                        work with cards that require NFC to work such as bank cards. However, there is a workaround which
                        will be mentioned next.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Redirectable Cards (redirected)</h3>
                    <p>If any type of card for whatever reason cannot be saved on the app, there is the option to redirect
                        the user to the source app that the card is on, this can be done through granting permissions to the
                        application to have access to redirecting the user to the specific card stored on that app.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>App Redirection (redirected)</h3>

                    <p>If the redirection of cards cannot work, the user can manually set a shortcut to open the app where
                        the desired cards are stored, it may not be as efficient as the other methods, but if a user
                        frequently uses the application this may be used in some cases instead of directly</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Direct Scan (experimental / questionable legality)</h3>
                    <p>With Apple, Google and Samsung announcing their phones can be used as terminals for businesses to
                        accept payments through their NFC chips, our application has the potential to use the NFC chips in
                        modern smartphones to read the signal provided by a card in close proximity to the phone and
                        duplicate the signal to be stored on the application, to be later used through the application. This
                        should work with all cards that use radio frequency identification (RFID) or have an NFC chip if
                        functional. This should be ideal for cards that are used by hotels or businesses and education
                        institutions that use these cards only in physical form. Despite the intent of this functionality is
                        ultimately for convenience, this can easily be abused by many malicious individuals in many
                        malicious use cases. From credit card skimming and fraudulent transactions as a result, the
                        universality of this function can be easily used for criminal activity and may even increase
                        unauthorised transactions and crimes as a whole.
                        Ultimately this function would require a lot of testing and legal consultation so that it can be
                        effective while also minimising the amount of criminal activity.
                        From a business perspective this type of function is currently not available on the market, and
                        being able to use the function effectively may result in the application receiving widespread
                        adoption as there is no other program that does this.
                        Despite this mobile function being an innovation, personally, if there is still a big risk of this
                        function being used in criminal activity, the idea may be scrapped in its entirety to prevent legal
                        repercussions.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>All of that was mentioned prior were ways to store/access your cards in the application, which are
                        the primary functions of the app.
                    <p>
                        <br>
                    <h3>Some other QOL functions:</h3>
                    <p>Managing and sorting cards through folders, removing cards, updating cards if they expire or renew,
                        track previous payments, customizable UI, data encryption add to application function supported by
                        businesses own applications for (like “add to apple pay” button)

                    <h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
                    <p>To develop the application, a mobile internal development environment (IDE) will be required to
                        develop the fundamentals of the application, something like Visual studio would be appropriate
                        (mostly because Iam familiar with it), but many IDEs can be suitable for this application for a
                        variety of programming languages like java and python.
                        If the application is being developed through Visual studio, windows workstations would be the
                        computers used to develop the app. Local backups will be made regularly on the computer and also on
                        a server, with a cloud storage service used as offsite backups.
                        While this application is going to be primarily used with modern smartphones with NFC chips, the
                        application should still work with phones without NFC chips (with limited functionality). So it's
                        important when doing internal testing that a wide range of phones with different operating systems
                        and hardware specifications (especially older phones without NFC chips) are tested for errors and
                        bugs.
                        A Lot of the data stored on the applications will need to be encrypted so that people trying to gain
                        unauthorised access to the data cannot if they attempt to read the data
                        Also there will be development builds sent to testers regularly for feedback on UX/UI and if any
                        bugs and errors are present in that build.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="box9">
                    <h2>Skills Required</h2>

                    <p>There are many skills required to develop this application some of which are quite specialised.
                        When developing the application, skills in backend and frontend development is important for
                        fundamentals of mobile applications. Knowledge in a viable programming language for this kind of
                        application is needed to build an application that fulfils all of its requirements.
                        Knowledge in how NFC chips and how to utilise them (especially in mobile phones) is key to be able
                        to make transactions and to potentially develop the “direct scan” feature for this application.
                        The knowledge on how to store these cards locally on the device so that some features won't require
                        an internet connection (such as NFC data and photos), and the ability to encrypt data so that if the
                        device is stolen people can't access the sensitive data despite having access to the phone.

                    <h2>Our Plan</h2>
                    <p> Our group for assignment 3 will lay out a plan for the requirements needed to develop a prototype.
                        This prototype will not be a completely working prototype but should be working and have the
                        majority of its functions working due to technical limitations at our skill level. If we can plan
                        out all the details that would be needed for the development of our prototype, with leeway for
                        issues, we should be able to develop our prototype without any issues. Additionally, our group has
                        many different interests and skills, meaning all of our members can apply those skills for this
                        project making it something we all can participate in. Hopefully our skills and interests can help
                        us develop a prototype that meets all the requirements of the plan.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h2>Outcome</h2>
                    <p>If the project is successful and gains widespread usage, many more businesses will take the
                        application into consideration when developing cards and scannable items so that they can be
                        natively supported on the app. Users will be able to use all their cards and scannable items in one
                        place, solving the issue of the inconvenience of having multiple virtual wallets, making their lives
                        more efficient and potentially making physical wallets less of a need in society. If the development
                        is successful and widely adopted, hopefully most of the cards and scannable items can be natively
                        supported so that app redirection function is less of a need so that all your items can be stored in
                        the one app, which is ultimately the vision of the project.
