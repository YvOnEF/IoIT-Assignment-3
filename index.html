                    <p>Hi, my name is Yifan Shen, Yvon is my English name. I am from Shanghai, an international metropolis
                        located in the middle of the eastern coastline of China. Chinese is my native language. I have been
                        in Melbourne for about three years. Throughout high school, because of my strong interest in IT, I
                        have studied Applied Computing and Software Development. Computers have always given me a platform
                        to demonstrate my creativity and increase my general knowledge. For my previous coursework, I
                        designed a project plan which related to the COVID-19 drone monitoring in Applied Computing and made
                        a program which I called it for "Filter Bubble" in Software Development. This gave me a great number
                        of experiences in IT. In my spare time, I sometimes create some small programs, testing out new
                        functions or combining old features which provides me a good opportunity to see my progress as a
                        software developer. The major for further education that I pursue here in RMIT is Information
                        Technology. In my leisure time, I have a great number of hobbies. Playing the piano can be one of
                        them. Doing sports is also an integral part of my life. In my spare time, I love road-bike cycling.
                        During the ride, I can not only relax my mind, exercise my body, but also enjoy the beautiful
                        scenery along the way. I also enjoy playing tennis, basketball and badminton. Collecting things is
                        also one of my favourite hobbies, ranging from sneakers, Pokémon cards, coins, stamps, etc. My
                        most-liked thing to do on vocations is to travel. It is undoubtedly a fantastic thing to go and see
                        where you want to go, photographing and discover the beauty of the earth. The place I most look
                        forward to is Antarctica. For photography, for adventure, for icebergs, for wildlife, for another
                        world…

                        Greetings, my name is Roy Loh. I am a Malaysian Chinese international student studying information
                        technology in RMIT university. I completed my WACE exams in 2020 but took a gap year due to Covid. I
                        can speak English and mandarin. I enjoy watching videos on computer setups I cannot afford on the
                        internet and anime in my free time. I work casually as a coffee barista at a hotel. As an
                        international student in Melbourne, I find it quite challenging due to it being a new environment,
                        however I am slowly getting used to the culture here. I dream to earn enough money so I can travel
                        around the world. I aspire to work in the technology industry in the future and I hope to learn
                        useful skills such as programming and broaden my knowledge regarding the world of tech.

                    <p>
                        Hello I'm Michael Khalil, I'm currently 18 years of age as of 2022 and just finished highschool last
                        year completing VCE. As of this year I am currently enrolled at RMIT Melbourne studying my first
                        year for my Bachelor of Information technology degree. I was born here in Australia but both sides
                        of my family came from Egypt, with both my parents moving from Egypt to Melbourne as migrants.
                        Because of my constant exposure to Egyptian culture and the Arabic language, I understand spoken
                        Arabic vaguely (but cant read it!) and can barely speak it. Through primary and high school I also
                        know basic Italian. My hobbies and interests include, Video Games, computer hardware, IT as a whole,
                        japanese cars and modifying them, as well as motorsports in general (especially Formula 1!), and
                        even a bit of anime.

                        last year, and currently studying at Rmit Bachelor of IT. I was born and raised in tonga, an island
                        located to the east side of Australia, close to New zealand. Tonga is a beautiful island surrounded
                        with white beaches and coral reefs and covered with tropical rainforests. Although I was born in
                        tonga, both my parents are chinese therefore I am from the nationality of China. The language that
                        we speak at home is Mandarin no matter whether our family is in Tonga or Australia. My hobbies and
                        interests are actually playing basketball and watching the nba, video games and sneakers.

		Based on the ideal jobs of the group, we can tell that some members of the group share similar career plans while others differ.
		Some group members like Taha, Yifan and Michael want a career in software development while others want a more front end job, like Andy who aspires
		to be a web developer, Ronny in front end development and Roy who wants to be a solutions architect. Roy. Ronny and Andy’s job involves more 
		interaction with the end user compared to Taha, Yifan and Michael’s job which mostly focuses on getting things done behind the scenes. 
		Roy’s ideal job requires shifting priorities, it also involves understanding business needs and communicating with stakeholders while using tools
		provided by cloud, having to focus on multiple things rather than one, thus differentiating it from other jobs.
		However out of all the back end development, Yifan is the only one interested in specifically IOS software development.

                <h2 id="pdesc">Project Description</h2>
                <h3> Overview </h3>
                    	    <p>Our project is a mobile application that is essentially a virtual wallet designed to be a unified hub for all forms of virtual cards, 
			QR codes and virtual tickets. This idea can be innovative because there are many different types of services that can store credit cards 
			(eg: apple pay and google play), and some less popular virtual cards and/or QR Codes used in other non wallet apps may use a different 
			application or not even be available on a virtual wallet service, meaning a user might need multiple applications and multiple accounts 
			to use all their virtual cards on their phone. This application will be designed so that all these cards and scannable codes and items can 
			be stored in one place, as a unified “eWallet”, making a card holder’s life easier and more efficient when dealing with scannable items on 
			their phone. </p>
		<h3>Motivation</h3>
			    <p>
			This idea has come from personal experiences, with statistics and global trends making this idea more viable. When I make cashless payments, 
			the majority of those transactions are made through Apple pay which I find to be much more convenient than taking out my physical wallet. 
			The only time I need to regularly take out my wallet is when taking public transport to touch on and off my miki, which for me personally is a
			mild inconvenience when we already have these technologies in place in our phones through near field communication (NFC). Although a miki can
			be stored on mobile through google pay, the initial inconvenience still stands, having multiple wallet/card applications can be less efficient
			and convenient than a simple physical wallet! Especially when we are moving into a more digitised society. The solution is simple, people can 
			have all their physical cards stored in one wallet, so all that is needed is one application to store everything, not multiple applications. 
			This idea of convenience and practicality is the key motivation for my project. Data proves that this type of technology is becoming
			increasingly popular, with virtual wallets becoming increasingly more adopted. With 900 million transactions at the start of the pandemic 
			increasing to almost 1.5 billion in 2021, a 25% increase, which is set to go above 33% in the coming years. The growth has been so large in 
			fact that 45% of all eCommerce transactions were through mobile in 2021, which is twice as large as the payments done via debit cards and three
			times of debit card payments.
			    </p>
		<h3>Landscape</h3>
			    <p>
			There are many similar products like Apple pay and Google pay in the market, however our product differs from them with these two features:
			<li>User Inserted Scannable Cards (locally stored): If a scannable item isn't supported by the institution, then the user can take a photo 
			or screenshot of QR code or other scannable item that does not send a signal and then save it in the wallet, making it so that the code can 
			still be scanned in the app without redirecting to another app or even referring to a physical voucher/docket that may have been given to them.</li>
			<li>Direct Scan: With Apple, Google and Samsung announcing their phones can be used as terminals for businesses to accept payments through 
			their NFC chips, our application has the potential to use the NFC chips in modern smartphones to read the signal provided by a card 
			in close proximity to the phone and duplicate the signal to be stored on the application, to be later used through the application. 
			This should work with all cards that use radio frequency identification (RFID) or have an NFC chip if functional. 
			This should be ideal for cards that are used by hotels or businesses and education institutions that use these cards only in physical form
				    </li>

                    <h3 id ="aims"> Aims </h3>
                        <p>
                        Our concept is a smartphone application that functions as a virtual wallet, serving as a central
                        location for all types of virtual cards, QR codes, and virtual tickets. As there are many different 
                        types of services that can store credit cards (e.g., apple pay and google play), and some less 
                        popular virtual cards and/or QR Codes used in other non wallet apps may require a different 
                        application or may not even be obtainable on a virtual wallet service, a user may need various 
                        applications and accounts to use any of their virtual cards on their phone. Our aim is to provide
                        a functioning mobile application that integrates the use of near field communication (NFC) with
                        Card / QR storage in order to essentially provide users with a unified “eWallet” making a card 
                        holder’s life easier and more efficient when dealing with scannable items on their phone, with the
                        use of this application, our biggest target to achieve would be to create a functioning ewallet that 
                        allows for a convenient and straightforward experience for all users. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        A goal that will assist us in achieving our aim would be for large institutions and banks to combine
                        their cards with our application, this could mean that banking customers would no longer require 
                        physical cards but instead their bank cards would be immediately incorporated into our application, 
                        This is also true for any card producer such as ptv, arcades, universities, gyms etc. This feature,
                        if achieved, could contribute greatly to adding more convenience for the users, thus allowing us to
                        further our progression towards our aim.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Another goal that can help the team in achieving our aims is for system wide integration of our
                        Application within a tech company with influence, such as Apple or Android. With the addition of 
                        our application with their operating systems, these companies can soar our teams efforts in broadening
                        The user base of our application. With the introduction of an increase in users utilizing the ewallet,
                        More user feedback can be received which will allow for more accurate changes to be made to better
                        Suit the users needs and requirements, more features will be able to be added 
                        as well as user requests
                        Would flood in. this will not only allow for a more widespread deployment of our app, But also allows
                        for us to partner with those corporations and continue developing the software and hardware to 
                        allow for a greater user experience whilst using our app.

			<p>
                        <h3> Stage 1: Planning </h3>
			<p>
			During the planning stage, we have decided to use two different platforms. Android and iOS are 
			structured differently from each other, therefore we decided to use two different tech stacks. Choosing
			our tech stacks for our mobile application is a crucial step for us. A good tech stack will help us reduce
			time, save cost in development, and open up opportunities for any future projects. We have decided to
			not use a hybrid stack, even though it will be more cost-efficient, we didn't want to give to give up 
			functionality and UX. Therefore, we decided to separate our tech stacks, into Android and iOS. 

			In our IOS tech stack, we have chosen Swift as our programming language over Objective-C, as it
			is the more preferred language over Objective-C. For our iOS development tools, we have chosen 
			Xcode, an IDE powered by Apple which provides features needed to develop a native iOS app.
			for our UI framework (for user interface), we have decided on UIkit over SwiftUI, due to the fact 
			that Swift UI only supports the later versions of iOS, locking out the older versions.

			In our Android tech stack, Kotlin was our choice as the programming language that will be used. 
			Kotlin was chosen over the ever so popular Java due to it being more simple to use, which can
			enable projects to be delivered faster. For our Android development tools, we have chosen Android
			studio, the official development platform powered by Google. For out UI frameworks, Android provides
			a pre-built Android UI software, however we have chosen Jetpack Compose, due to it allowing a
			more simplified and accelerated development. 

			Next, we had to estimate the costs for the mobile app development. Depending on app complexity,
			it can cost between $60,000 to $150,000 on simple app developments and more than $300,000 on 
			more complex app developments. In Australia, programmers earn about $100 to $120 an hour, while
			other countries like India have an hourly rate of $30. Since we chose to launch on two platforms and 
			use two different stacks instead of a higher stack, our costs will be relatively high. Therefore when 
			choosing our team, we kept the costs in mind, while seeing whether the pros outweigh the cons. 
			We decided to outsource to a development company overseas. Outsourcing is a good option as 
			It has many benefits, such as being cost efficient while maintaining high quality. Foreign companies 
			also adhere to guidelines and ensure that they stay throughout the project, unlike freelancers, and 
			are much cheaper than putting together a team. 

			Finally, we implemented some milestones and deadlines, to ensure that the app will be developed
			within the given time. We are targeting the app development to be completed in 3 months from now, 
			so we can proceed to other stages such as testing, deployment and eventually the marketing of 
			the app itself.
			
			</p>
			<br>
		 	<h3>Stage 2: Design and Development</h3>
			<p>
			To create a better understanding of our user’s needs, we created a persona, along with a context
			scenario and key scenarios.
			Creating a persona: Jonathan Jonas
			<br>
			<img src="Harold.jpeg" alt='harold' height='500px'>
			<br>
			Background:
			<li>50 years old</li>
			<li>Lives in Glen Waverley, Victoria</li>
			<li>Works as a project manager in the city</li>
			Needs and goals:
			<li>Always has to take out myki card when taking the train to work, wishes that he could 
			just use his phone, however he uses an apple phone which does not store myki in it’s
			wallet unlike google pay on androids</li>
			Skills and experience:
			<li>Familiar with iOS </li>
			<li>Limited driving expertise</li>
			Creating a context scenario:
			Jonathan is a 50 year old man who works in the city. Jonathan takes the train to the city during the weekdays as he does not own a car. 
			However, Jonathan is frustrated that he has to search through his wallet for his myki card everyday. He uses an iphone which does not 
			have a feature to store myki credits, unlike google pay. One day during his lunch break, Jonathan rants to his co-workers about his frustration.
			Jack the intern suggested to Jonathan to try out the app <insert app name>. He explains to Jonathan that the app is a mobile application that is 
			essentially a virtual wallet designed to be a unified hub for all forms of virtual cards, QR codes and virtual tickets. He further explains to 
			Jonathan that this application is designed so that all these cards and scannable codes and items can be stored in one place, as a unified “eWallet”,
			which can make Jonathan's  life easier and more efficient when dealing with scannable items on their phone. Jonathan sets up his <insert app name>
			account and puts in his credit card details. When Jonathan leaves work for home, he opens the app and taps his phone at the gate, the transaction 
			approves, and the gate opens, Jonathan decides that he would no longer need to bring his bulky wallet along with him when he leaves the house.

			During this stage, we focused more on UX design - the visual side of the app. We decided to keep
			the design of our app minimalistic and simple, as our application’s main purpose is to function as 
			a wallet.  We chose Dark Blue as our primary color, because it gives users a more modern feeling, 
			it matched the service we provide by using high end tech to make people’s life more convenient. 
			We chose orange as the color for most of buttons as it contrast with the dark blue, making all the
			buttons stand out from the User Interface therefore when the user looks at the page, it is easier for 
			them to recognize where the buttons are immediately. For the Menu Bar, we used the industry standard
			Icon “Burger Menu”, so when the users see it, they would immediately know what it used for. And all the 
			the size of fonts are the same, it makes the user interface more consistant.

			We then planned out the minimum viable product for our application. We made a list of features for
			our application. Features included:
			<li>Store QR codes in “My Codes”</li>
			<li>Add cards such as credit cards and Transport Card (MyKi)</li>
			<li>Scan and add QR option (take photo from camera or from library)</li>
			<li>Edit Profile Info</li>
			<li>Using Credit card to pay</li>
			<li>Using digital transport card like myki</li>
			We wanted to deliver a solution that appeals to or ideal customers, so we wanted to focus more on 
			implementing certain features that enable users to have the true experience of having a virtual unified 
			wallet.
                    </p>
			<br>
			<h3>Stage 3: Development</h3>
			<p>
			The development of the software solution can be split up into two sections. The front end of the application, such as the layout and user 
			interface of the application. And the back end of the application, such as all the functions that make the application work, usually things
			that cannot be seen by the user.

			Front end

			The front end of our application needs to be simple and easy to use, so that users can not waste any time accessing what they need. 
			Our application would be counterintuitive  if it would take multiple keystrokes and user inputs to access a card and other items of relevance.
			Because of this, as soon as the application is opened the first thing the user should see are the cards they have so they can make a 
			transaction quickly after opening the app, and also below these cards will be the scannable items such as qr codes and barcodes so that they 
			also can be accessed quickly on the same page. Other external options not relevant for day to day use should be hidden away for less clutter 
			through a burger box menu. Such as adding other 
			</p>
			<br>
				
		<h3>Stage 4: Testing</h3>	
			<p>
			The testing process will be conducted through user testing where we invite random people to test our application, the hiring process will be 
			done through social media and we will provide monetary reward for the test of our application. Not only that, we will also be hiring a quality 
			assurance team first to provide a more professional and thorough test for the application, this ensures that the test is done to perfection and that they are to discover any bugs that a normal user wouldn’t find in their day to day usage of our application. The quality assurance team will make sure that the application:
				<li>Is running properly</li>
				<li>No Lagging</li>
				<li>No Bugs</li>
				<li>Is the app easy to use?</li>
				Bugs in the application means bad UX, leading to the failure of the application, there are two testing phases in app development:
				<li>Core testing</li> 
				<li>On demand testing</li> 
			Testings are the most essential steps of app development, and beta gives you a look at the flaw of the current version of your app. 
			Therefore the earlier the test the better. The core testing phase essentially is done by professionals to see whether an app is 
			compatible on mobile devices, either IOS or android. This is done through usability testing, to ensure this segment of the testing 
			is successful, the testing team will need to assign users and engage them in the app and provide feedback with the results of their 
			experience. The importance of user and major reason to use usability tests is to check the users friendliness of the solution and 
			understand whether the application can support the businesses marketing objectives. The testing team will ensure that the results 
			gathered and changes made are adding value to the convenience and that the user can reach their end goal with ease, it also measures 
			if the application is up to the users expectation and that its working as it should be. On demand testing is the application's 
			performance testing that includes response to users request, screen load up,  battery usage and optimization, size of application, 
			laid time with concurrent users, and API functions. This also tests the tenacity of the minor to the major aspects of the application 
			including the servers, network requirement, software and hardware compatibility. At the end of all the steps and considerations above,
			the testing team will also test the app with an unusual amount of users to replicate a consumer demand spike and observe whether the 
			app is still running smoothly or the opposite, where lags and bugs are presented. Finally, the most important step is the security
			check. Due to the nature of our application, we deal with consumers' sensitive data and personal information, so this step is extremely
			vital. This can be done through an online automated tool and also reassured by the assurance team to remove any malware, spyware or 
			bugs that could be present within the app.
			</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Stage 5: Deployment</h3>
			<p>
			After the minimum viable product passes the testing stage, we decided to deploy the app onto both Google play store and the App store, 
			uploading on different platforms have different requirements, such as Google Play requiring promotional material for the application. 
			Promotional materials include pictures and videos. Next, we have to implement configuration options and provide privacy policies. After that, 
			we have to implement access rights and pricing. Finally, we have to continuously configure and publish the app to be stable. For iOS, the App 
			store starts with us filling in information about the app on a provided form, including the name, page, icon, description, privacy policy and 
			key words of the product. With the AppStore, we submit the application build via Xcode. Apple’s employees will test our products to ensure it 
			can be made live on their platform. After that, we focus on the code after launching the MVP, and focus on other business aspects such as 
			looking for investors and marketing our application.
			</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Stage 6: Final Stage</h3>
			<p>
			After launching our minimum viable product as beta, we will receive feedback from users based on their experiences. From the user’s feedback, 
			we can observe what the users are fond of and what issues they faced when using the app. From this we can improve the application by removing 
			unnecessary features or bugs, while adding more viable features.After our minimum viable product has succeeded in gaining attention, we will 
			need to focus on full scale marketing, to ensure our product reaches users out there. This is where our marketing team will market our products
			to reach users on both iOS and Android platforms, by social media advertisements on Facebook, YouTube and Instagram, as millions of users 
			interact on these platforms every day.
			</p>
			<br>
			<h3 id="roles">Roles</h3>
			<p>
			Frontend developers (Andy) The project manager will be Michael because it was obviously his project idea. The front end developer will be Roy, 
			Ronny and Andy where we are incharge of the UI and UX interface of our application. Roy, ronny and I, despite the interest and skills in 
			various areas of a front end developer, we all should have the skills to create an interface for the suitability of our app. Although my ideal 
			job is to be a website developer, and seems irrelevant to our mobile app development, to become a website developer, user studies and user
			testing is a skill that a website developer should have, therefore I can use that knowledge to assist with the UI/UX development of our app. 
			For Roy, his responsibility is to keep and maintain the running of our app, he is incharge of the data and users personal details stored in 
			the cloud are secure and up to date when users change their information. And finally, Ronny is the actual developer of the UI/UX of the 
			application as his ideal job is to become a frontend developer and he is passionate about UI/UX development. The Skills that Ronny currently 
			has are basic HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, Git, which is a good start for an application developer if he chooses to go down that path. 
			The roles of each person of the frontend developer will be kept stagnant from week to week, as we are incharge of very different components 
			of the design and maintenance of our application. 
			</p>
			<p>
			Backend Developers (Ronny) in our team are required know at least two programming languge, because our project are expected to run in two 
			operating system which is android and apple, more than that, they are need to know SQL for operating the database that be used to store 
			personal infomation of users. But Backend developers in our team should know more than just coding, communicating the UI/UX designers and 
			frontend developers is essential, due to lacking programming knowledge for designers, it would be easy for them to ignore the complexity 
			of creating elements in the backend. In the real world, there are many limitations for developers to follow the prototype designers give, 
			the reason might be the compatibility of operating system, the size of screen of targeted Audience,so backend developers need to communicate 
			in the team and give advice on the design as well.
			</p>
			<br>
			<h3 id="sandl">Scope and limits</h3>
			<p>
			There are certain constraints that can limit the app development and success of the app:
			<p>Economic constraints</p> 
			<img src="economy" alt='economy' height='500px'>
			<li>Consumer interest is influenced by how familiar they are with a certain product, or whether it is available in their region. A consumer will 
			not use a product they are unfamiliar with, or a product that does not exist to them. It is important to invest in  marketing strategies to 
			ensure that the app reaches to other consumers so that they can try the product. However, some users are not willing to try out new products, 
			unless there is an increasing trend in it. Other factors including competition might push the app out of the market. Due to consumer loyalty, 
			it might be difficult for the app to penetrate both the android and apple app market.</li>
			</p>
			<p>
			<p>Time constraints</p> 
		    	<img src="Deadlines" alt='deadline' height='500px'>
			<li>Enterprises often struggle to meet the ever growing demand of consumers for  the development of mobile applications. Businesses and users often
			have unrealistic expectations, wanting more unnecessary features that are difficult to add within the given period of time. Mobile app 
			development often takes roughly between 3 to 6 months, and organizations often struggle to make it in time, causing the app to have issues 
			due to being not tested properly.</li>
			</p>
			<p>
			<p>Technological constraints</p>  
		    	<img src="robot.jpg" alt='Robot' height='500px'>
			<li>Creating a secure, quick, intuitive, and feature-rich eWallet application of any sort is a difficult work for a professional eWallet app
			development company. To guarantee that our project is completed to a satisfactory level, we should ensure that multiple back end engineers 
			that understand the coding languages are working on the job together, this mitigates the chances of errors occurring, we may all engage an 
			eWallet app development company with relevant experience. Their expertise will assist us in ensuring that the same mistakes are not made twice,
			and to create an eWallet application free of errors. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are making it easier to create trustworthy 
			and technologically advanced e-wallet apps all over the world.</li>
			</p>
			<p>
		   	<p>Moral and legal constraints </p>
			<img src="judge" alt='judge' height='500px'>
			<p>Privacy Act 1988 </p>
		    	<li>Many people have demanded some sort of legal protection from people who might gather
			data about their browsing habits over the Internet, because of the rapid growth of electronic 
			transactions. The government has keen to encourage the development of electronic commerce,
			while also protecting the confidentiality of consumers and building public confidence in electronic
			transactions.</li>
			<br>
		    	<p>Information Privacy Principles (IPPs)</p>
			<li>Sensitive information: Organizations need to ensure that they do not collect sensitive information 
			about people, such as their religion, political beliefs or criminal records, without checking the
			applicable laws.</li>
			<li>Collection of personal information: When an organization collects information, it should only 
			collect the information it needs. The organization should inform people that their information is
			being collected.</li>
			<li>Data quality: Ensure that the information collected is accurate, complete and up-to-date.</li>
			<li>Data Security: Information must be protected from misuse, loss, authorized access, modification or
			disclosure. Reasonable steps must be taken to destroy or de-identify personal information that is
		        no longer needed.</li>
			<li>Transborder data flows: If your personal information travels outside Victoria, your privacy 
			protections must travel with it.</li>
			<li>Access and correction: When an organization collects information it should allow people to see 
			the information it collects about them and provide them with the opportunity to correct it if it is 
			inaccurate.</li>

			<h4>Apple software:</h4>
		    	<img src="apple.jpg" alt='apple' height='500px'>
			<h4>Swift </h4>
			<p>
			Swift is a modern intuitive programming language for iOS, which is designed safely and produces
			software that runs quickly. Swift is based on the latest research on programming languages, 
			with decades of combined experience of Apple platform development. Named parameters are 
			expressed cleanly in a syntax that enables APIs in Swift to more easily be read and maintained.
			Programmers using Swift do not need to input semicolons, inferred typing makes code more
			presentable and less error prone while headers are eliminated by modules and namespaces are 
			provided. Strings use a UTF-8 based encoding for performance optimization for a wide-variety of use
			cases , and are Unicode-correct to best support international languages and emoji. Tight-deterministic
			referencing counting is used to manage memory, keeping memory usage to a minimum without
			collection of garbage.
			</p>
			<h4>Xcode</h4>
			<p>
			Xcode 13 consists of powerful new team development features which allow collaboration with Xcode
			Cloud, Github and Bitbucket. Features include initiating, reviewing, commenting within the code,
			merging pull requests directly within Xcode and comparing different versions of code files. 
			</p>
			<h4>UIkit</h4>
			<p>
			A UI kit is a collection of assets containing design elements such as UI components and styles,
			examples of UI components include navigation menus, widgets and input forms. UI components are
			elements that provide functionality and convey meanings to the users. UI kits typically consist of 
			mock-ups for a solution in a particular field. UI kits can improve design workflow by:
			<li>Speeding up design processes: Ui kits allow the simplification of the task of finding a solution 
			to a design problem. There are ready-to-use UI elements from the kit available instead of having
			to make new ones from scratch.</li>
			<li>Achieving a consistent design: UI kits can become a foundation for the design system due to
			the design elements from a UI kit having a difficult consistency to achieve when combining
			multiple elements from different libraries.</li>
			<li>Mastering design skills: Designers are presented with opportunities to inspect different
			components and learn how to build or improve similar components by themselves.</li>
			</p>
			<h4>Android software: </h4>
		    	<img src="android.png" alt='android' height='500px'>
			<h4>Kotlin</h4>
			<p>
			Kotlin is a programming language developed by Jetbrains, it provides interoperability with Java,
			which means existing skills and knowledge from Java can be used, enabling Kotlin to be used
			for development of Android application projects. The key features of Kotlin include:
			<li>Java interoperability: Existing skills and knowledge in Java can be transferred to Kotlin. 
			Java developers can continue writing Android apps using their current language</li>
			<li>Null Safety: Kotlin prevents errors that are caused by absent parameters that are not correctly initialized.</li>
			<li>Properties with Getters and Setters Automatically Created: Kotlin comes with properties That consists of getters and setters generated 
			automatically, making coding and reading of Android apps are a lot quicker.</li>
			<li>Concise Syntax: Code is concise and easily read by developer, as there are no unnecessary Tokens or keywords</li>
			</p>
			<h4>Android Studio</h4>
			<p>
			Android Studio is the official IDE, built for Android for development acceleration and aid in building of high quality Android applications. 
			Some features include:
			<li>Apply changes: Android Studio’s Apply change feature allows user to push code and 
			change resources without restarting the app or current activity. This provide user with flexibility
			to control the app when making small changes during deployment and testing, without making
			much changes to the current state of the device.</li>
			<li>Intelligent code editor: The code editor aids user in writing better code, work faster and be
			more productive. This is enabled by offering advanced code completion, refactoring and 
			analyzing code.</li>
			<li>Fast and feature-rich emulator: The Android Emulator installs and starts up an app quicker
			than the real device, and allows testing and prototyping the app on various Android device
			configurations. A variety of hardware features such as GPS location, multi-touch input and
			network latency can be stimulated.</li>
			</p>
			<h4>Jetpack compose</h4>
			<p>
			Jetpack Compose is Android’s modern toolkit used to build native UI. t accelerates and simplifies UI development on Android. 
			Some benefits of using Jetpack Compose include:
			<li>Less code: Compose enable user to do more without writing too much code which makes it easier and more simpler to maintain 
			and less error prone</li>
			<li>Intuitive: Compose uses a declarative API where the user describes the UI, while Compose
			takes care of the rest. The APIs are intuitive- they are easy to discover and use. With 
			Compose, the user builds small, stateless components that are not bound to a specific
			activity, allowing them to reuse and test. </li>
			<li>Accelerated development: Compose is compatible with all types of existing code, and most 
			common libraries work with Compose, therefore the code can be adopted from wherever at
			Anytime. Using the full Android Studio support, features like live preview allow code to be 
			Iterated and read faster, which saves time.</li>

			<h3 id="Test">Testing</h3>
			<p>
			Testings will be conducted on various elements that includes the phone compatibility, security vulnerabilities and application instabilities. 
			First and foremost, Our application will mainly run for phone users to enhance the conveniences of payments and collect points for rewards. 
			We will test our application on a variety of phones including (ios, and android), as our project is conducted around the convenience of mobile
			phone usage, to know that this is successful is that the application runs on all androids and ios phones that are compatible. Because we are 
			dealing with clients and users sensitive data we have to ensure the security of their data and credit card details. This would be a high 
			priority of the testing as leaking consumer data is wrong, unprofessional and laws can be taken into the situation. To ensure the success of 
			this, we will incorporate malware and spyware detections and remove any threats that are a threat to consumers data and privacy. The feature 
			to hide the credit card or reward number to protect consumers privacy when they are in a place where there are other people or in situations
			where they lose their phone. Finally, we will test the stability of our application to determine if it crashes, lags, or does not work in the 
			way we want it to. To test this we will run our prototype or the actual application to see whether it's running smoothly or need fixing up. 
			The way we will test our application is through user testing, where we will invite random people in all fields such as age and tech experts 
			and non tech people to use our application. We will at least have 1000 people to test our application so that we can get broader and accurate 
			feedback. Despite that, We will also hire a quality assurance team for more professional testing. Where they are trained to go through thorough
			testing that users might not experience in their day to day use of our application. This is done first before we actually get random people to
			test our application to ensure that their user experience in the testing stage is smooth.

		    	<h3>Security</h3>
		    	<img src="Security.jpg" alt='security' height='500px'>
			<p>
			<ol> Unsafe and Defective Networking </ol>
			<li>In a conventional mobile app, data will be transmitted between client and server. The app relies on the provider's network on the mobile 
			device and also utilizes the internet whenever information is being sent. Cybercriminals can abuse mobile security breaches and steal 
			confidential data and information from users. Due to the inaccuracy in the security mechanism, there is a threat of confidential information 
			being leaked, such as session IDs, credentials and other sensitive data. Some mobile app developers utilize SSL/TLS certificates for 
			authentication, however even the presence of a SSL/TLS does not guarantee the safety of the mobile application, therefore highly secured 
			mechanisms must be implemented on the app to prevent the threat of a cyber breach.
			</li>
		    	<br>
			<ol> Unreliable data storage</ol>
			<li>The risk of using unauthorized data storage can cause data breaches. A mobile app requires proper encryption algorithms to prevent hackers
			from having access to the mobile device.

			<ol>Poor UX/UI integration</ol>
			<li>The importance of a good UI and UX implementation is essential for mobile applications. A good user experience is crucial towards an application’s success. 
			A user can traverse a web presence if a good interface is implemented. 
			If an application is poorly designed and too complicated to use, it will cause dissatisfaction among users.</li>
			<ol>Developing an invaluable app for users</ol>
			<li>While developing the app, it is essential to remember the end-user’s needs the entire time. 
			It is essential to conduct testing before launching the application as end users using the app are most knowledgeable about their requirements
			and needs.</li>
			<ol>Stuffing several functions in a single application</ol>
			<li>In the mobile app development industry, it is believed the more the functions, the greater the capabilities of the platform. 
			However, having too many functions can cause the app to become too complex and complicated to use. The user might have trouble navigating throughout the app. 
			It is essential to add the more significant features required by users and remove the redundant ones.</li>

			<ol>Designing an App for Many Platforms at the same time</ol>	
			<li>There are two primary app marketplaces, Google Play Store for android and App Store for IOS. There are roughly 2.2 million apps on the App 
			Store and 2.6 million on Google Play store. For smaller businesses, there is a cost risk for the mobile app if launched on both platforms 
			simultaneously. Two different development teams will be hired for each platform, and the cost of advertisements will also increase, thus 
			making it difficult to launch on both platforms at the same time.</li>

                    <h4>Android developer</h4>
                    <p>
                    Androids developers are software developers that build application running on android
		operational system, They are required to be familiar with one of main programming languages 
		Kotlin or Java. Kotlin is relatively new compared to Java, but it is getting more ore and more popular
		these days, due to it is more efficient while compiling it into the binary code, which makes it has better
		performance than java. However java is still the most popualr option among the developers, Android
		develoepr also have to know sqlite as well, they need to gather user infomation and store this data into
		database at some point, and sqlite is the language to achive that on android operating system. other than
		these technical skill, good developers also need to quipped quillities:
			    <li>problem solving skill</li>
			    <li>analytical skill</li>
			    <li>Critical thinking</li>
			    <li>Well Communication skill</li>
			    <li>Data Structure and Algorithm</li>

			</p>
			<br>
			<h4>Apple developer </h4>
			<p>
			An iOS developer is responsible for creating apps for Apple's iOS operating system-based mobile 
			devices. A professional iOS developer should be familiar with one of the platform's two programming 
			languages: Objective-C or Swift. They should also be well-versed in the patterns and practises that 
			revolve around the iOS platform. The responsibilities that and iOS developer have are:
			<li>Design and build applications for the iOS platform</li>
			<li>Ensure the performance, quality, and responsiveness of applications</li>
			<li>Collaborate with a team to define, design, and ship new features</li>
			<li>Identify and correct bottlenecks and fix bugs</li>
			<li>Help maintain code quality, organization, and automatization</li>
			Putting the app together entails combining three distinct aspects into a single functional whole. The 
			first is the back end, which is essentially everything that happens server-side; this is where the majority 
			of the app's heavy lifting takes place, including account authentication and management, notifications, 
			and the app's integration with third-party services like social media, not to mention the majority of the 
			processing and maintenance that keeps the app running. The second is the Application Programming 
			Interface, or API, which basically converts what's going on on the server into something that a user's 
			mobile device can comprehend. Finally, there's the front end, which includes everything with which 
			the user interacts directly. 
			</p>
			<br>
			<h4>UX designer</h4>
			<p>
			A small team of UX Designers will be brought on board to assess and produce a better product
			Which is more enjoyable for the end user. This is achieved through:
			<li>Research, including the use of interviews, surveys, and observation, 
			guides them to make the best decisions in the design process. </li>
			<li>Information architecture helps you organize and prioritize large and complex sets of information.</li>
			<li>Wireframing (building a skeletal framework for a website or app) enables them to explore design solutions in an efficient way.</li>
			<li>Prototyping is essential for testing functionality and identifying problems.</li>
			Through these skills, they UX designers are able to produce a quality app that looks and interacts 
			Well with the users.
			</p>
			<br>
			<h4>Software/penetration tester</h4>
			<p>
			A team of quality assurance team will be hired to inspect and test the applications in the beta version of the application. 
			A team of more than 2 will be hired to inspect the areas of: 
			<li>user data input</li>
			<li>functionality issues</li>
			<li>message and notifications</li>
			<li>performance issues</li>
			<li>device functionality</li>
			<li>security issues</li>
			Finally and most importantly where we will hire at least more than 5 to inspect and eliminate any threats. We will look to hire candidate will with the skills of: 
			<li>Analytic thinking</li>
			<li>Creativity</li>
			<li>Attention to details</li>
			<li>Flexibility </li>
			<li>Business oriented approach </li>
			<li>Communication skills </li>
			<li>Motivation</li>
			Due to the nature of this quality assurance team, where they are only incharge of the inspection of the application. IT based skills are not as relevant in this scenario.
