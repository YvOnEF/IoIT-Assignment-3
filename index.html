                    <p>Hi, my name is Yifan Shen, Yvon is my English name. I am from Shanghai, an international metropolis
                        located in the middle of the eastern coastline of China. Chinese is my native language. I have been
                        in Melbourne for about three years. Throughout high school, because of my strong interest in IT, I
                        have studied Applied Computing and Software Development. Computers have always given me a platform
                        to demonstrate my creativity and increase my general knowledge. For my previous coursework, I
                        designed a project plan which related to the COVID-19 drone monitoring in Applied Computing and made
                        a program which I called it for "Filter Bubble" in Software Development. This gave me a great number
                        of experiences in IT. In my spare time, I sometimes create some small programs, testing out new
                        functions or combining old features which provides me a good opportunity to see my progress as a
                        software developer. The major for further education that I pursue here in RMIT is Information
                        Technology. In my leisure time, I have a great number of hobbies. Playing the piano can be one of
                        them. Doing sports is also an integral part of my life. In my spare time, I love road-bike cycling.
                        During the ride, I can not only relax my mind, exercise my body, but also enjoy the beautiful
                        scenery along the way. I also enjoy playing tennis, basketball and badminton. Collecting things is
                        also one of my favourite hobbies, ranging from sneakers, Pokémon cards, coins, stamps, etc. My
                        most-liked thing to do on vocations is to travel. It is undoubtedly a fantastic thing to go and see
                        where you want to go, photographing and discover the beauty of the earth. The place I most look
                        forward to is Antarctica. For photography, for adventure, for icebergs, for wildlife, for another
                        world…

                        Greetings, my name is Roy Loh. I am a Malaysian Chinese international student studying information
                        technology in RMIT university. I completed my WACE exams in 2020 but took a gap year due to Covid. I
                        can speak English and mandarin. I enjoy watching videos on computer setups I cannot afford on the
                        internet and anime in my free time. I work casually as a coffee barista at a hotel. As an
                        international student in Melbourne, I find it quite challenging due to it being a new environment,
                        however I am slowly getting used to the culture here. I dream to earn enough money so I can travel
                        around the world. I aspire to work in the technology industry in the future and I hope to learn
                        useful skills such as programming and broaden my knowledge regarding the world of tech.

                    <p>
                        Hello I'm Michael Khalil, I'm currently 18 years of age as of 2022 and just finished highschool last
                        year completing VCE. As of this year I am currently enrolled at RMIT Melbourne studying my first
                        year for my Bachelor of Information technology degree. I was born here in Australia but both sides
                        of my family came from Egypt, with both my parents moving from Egypt to Melbourne as migrants.
                        Because of my constant exposure to Egyptian culture and the Arabic language, I understand spoken
                        Arabic vaguely (but cant read it!) and can barely speak it. Through primary and high school I also
                        know basic Italian. My hobbies and interests include, Video Games, computer hardware, IT as a whole,
                        japanese cars and modifying them, as well as motorsports in general (especially Formula 1!), and
                        even a bit of anime.

                        Hello I’m Jin Guo, Andy is my English name. I'm currently 18 years old and just finished year 12
                        last year, and currently studying at Rmit Bachelor of IT. I was born and raised in tonga, an island
                        located to the east side of Australia, close to New zealand. Tonga is a beautiful island surrounded
                        with white beaches and coral reefs and covered with tropical rainforests. Although I was born in
                        tonga, both my parents are chinese therefore I am from the nationality of China. The language that
                        we speak at home is Mandarin no matter whether our family is in Tonga or Australia. My hobbies and
                        interests are actually playing basketball and watching the nba, video games and sneakers.

                    <h3 id="aims"> Aims </h3>
                        <p>
                        Our concept is a smartphone application that functions as a virtual wallet, serving as a central
                        location for all types of virtual cards, QR codes, and virtual tickets. As there are many different 
                        types of services that can store credit cards (e.g., apple pay and google play), and some less 
                        popular virtual cards and/or QR Codes used in other non wallet apps may require a different 
                        application or may not even be obtainable on a virtual wallet service, a user may need various 
                        applications and accounts to use any of their virtual cards on their phone. Our aim is to provide
                        a functioning mobile application that integrates the use of near field communication (NFC) with
                        Card / QR storage in order to essentially provide users with a unified “eWallet” making a card 
                        holder’s life easier and more efficient when dealing with scannable items on their phone, with the
                        use of this application, our biggest target to achieve would be to create a functioning ewallet that 
                        allows for a convenient and straightforward experience for all users. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        A goal that will assist us in achieving our aim would be for large institutions and banks to combine
                        their cards with our application, this could mean that banking customers would no longer require 
                        physical cards but instead their bank cards would be immediately incorporated into our application, 
                        This is also true for any card producer such as ptv, arcades, universities, gyms etc. This feature,
                        if achieved, could contribute greatly to adding more convenience for the users, thus allowing us to
                        further our progression towards our aim.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Another goal that can help the team in achieving our aims is for system wide integration of our
                        Application within a tech company with influence, such as Apple or Android. With the addition of 
                        our application with their operating systems, these companies can soar our teams efforts in broadening
                        The user base of our application. With the introduction of an increase in users utilizing the ewallet,
                        More user feedback can be received which will allow for more accurate changes to be made to better
                        Suit the users needs and requirements, more features will be able to be added 
                        as well as user requests
                        Would flood in. this will not only allow for a more widespread deployment of our app, But also allows
                        for us to partner with those corporations and continue developing the software and hardware to 
                        allow for a greater user experience whilst using our app.

                    <h4> Stage 1: Planning </h4>
                    <p>
                    During the planning stage, we have decided to use two different platforms. Android and iOS are 
                    structured differently from each other, therefore we decided to use two different tech stacks. Choosing
                    our tech stacks for our mobile application is a crucial step for us. A good tech stack will help us reduce
                    time, save cost in development, and open up opportunities for any future projects. We have decided to
                    not use a hybrid stack, even though it will be more cost-efficient, we didn't want to give to give up 
                    functionality and UX. Therefore, we decided to separate our tech stacks, into Android and iOS. 

                    In our IOS tech stack, we have chosen Swift as our programming language over Objective-C, as it
                    is the more preferred language over Objective-C. For our iOS development tools, we have chosen 
                    Xcode, an IDE powered by Apple which provides features needed to develop a native iOS app.
                    for our UI framework (for user interface), we have decided on UIkit over SwiftUI, due to the fact 
                    that Swift UI only supports the later versions of iOS, locking out the older versions.

                    In our Android tech stack, Kotlin was our choice as the programming language that will be used. 
                    Kotlin was chosen over the ever so popular Java due to it being more simple to use, which can
                    enable projects to be delivered faster. For our Android development tools, we have chosen Android
                    studio, the official development platform powered by Google. For out UI frameworks, Android provides
                    a pre-built Android UI software, however we have chosen Jetpack Compose, due to it allowing a
                    more simplified and accelerated development. 

                    Next, we had to estimate the costs for the mobile app development. Depending on app complexity,
                    it can cost between $60,000 to $150,000 on simple app developments and more than $300,000 on 
                    more complex app developments. In Australia, programmers earn about $100 to $120 an hour, while
                    other countries like India have an hourly rate of $30. Since we chose to launch on two platforms and 
                    use two different stacks instead of a higher stack, our costs will be relatively high. Therefore when 
                    choosing our team, we kept the costs in mind, while seeing whether the pros outweigh the cons. 
                    We decided to outsource to a development company overseas. Outsourcing is a good option as 
                    It has many benefits, such as being cost efficient while maintaining high quality. Foreign companies 
                    also adhere to guidelines and ensure that they stay throughout the project, unlike freelancers, and 
                    are much cheaper than putting together a team. 

                    Finally, we implemented some milestones and deadlines, to ensure that the app will be developed
                    within the given time. We are targeting the app development to be completed in 3 months from now, 
                    so we can proceed to other stages such as testing, deployment and eventually the marketing of 
                    the app itself.

                    <h4>Stage 2: Design and Development</h4>
                    <p>
                    To create a better understanding of our user’s needs, we created a persona, along with a context
                    scenario and key scenarios.
                    Creating a persona:
                    Jonathan Jonas
                    Background:
                         <li>50 years old</li>
                         <li>Lives in Glen Waverley, Victoria</li>
                         <li>Works as a project manager in the city</li>
                    Needs and goals 
                         <li>Always has to take out myki card when taking the train to work, wishes that he could 
                             just use his phone, however he uses an apple phone which does not store myki in it’s
	                         wallet unlike google pay on androids</li>
                    Skills and experience
                         <li>Familiar with iOS </li>
                         <li>Limited driving expertise</li>
                    Creating a context scenario:
                    Jonathan is a 50 year old man who works in the city. Jonathan takes the train to the city during the weekdays as he does not own a car. 
                    However, Jonathan is frustrated that he has to search through his wallet for his myki card everyday. He uses an iphone which does not 
                    have a feature to store myki credits, unlike google pay. One day during his lunch break, Jonathan rants to his co-workers about his frustration.
                    Jack the intern suggested to Jonathan to try out the app <insert app name>. He explains to Jonathan that the app is a mobile application that is 
                    essentially a virtual wallet designed to be a unified hub for all forms of virtual cards, QR codes and virtual tickets. He further explains to 
                    Jonathan that this application is designed so that all these cards and scannable codes and items can be stored in one place, as a unified “eWallet”,
                    which can make Jonathan's  life easier and more efficient when dealing with scannable items on their phone. Jonathan sets up his <insert app name>
                    account and puts in his credit card details. When Jonathan leaves work for home, he opens the app and taps his phone at the gate, the transaction 
                    approves, and the gate opens, Jonathan decides that he would no longer need to bring his bulky wallet along with him when he leaves the house.

                    During this stage, we focused more on UX design - the visual side of the app. We decided to keep
                    the design of our app minimalistic and simple, as our application’s main purpose is to function as 
                    a wallet.  We chose Dark Blue as our primary color, because it gives users a more modern feeling, 
                    it matched the service we provide by using high end tech to make people’s life more convenient. 
                    We chose orange as the color for most of buttons as it contrast with the dark blue, making all the
                    buttons stand out from the User Interface therefore when the user looks at the page, it is easier for 
                    them to recognize where the buttons are immediately. For the Menu Bar, we used the industry standard
                    Icon “Burger Menu”, so when the users see it, they would immediately know what it used for. And all the 
                    the size of fonts are the same, it makes the user interface more consistant.

                    We then planned out the minimum viable product for our application. We made a list of features for
                    our application. Features included:
                        <li>Store QR codes in “My Codes”</li>
                        <li>Add cards such as credit cards and Transport Card (MyKi)</li>
                        <li>Scan and add QR option (take photo from camera or from library)</li>
                        <li>Edit Profile Info</li>
                        <li>Using Credit card to pay</li>
                        <li>Using digital transport card like myki</li>
                    We wanted to deliver a solution that appeals to or ideal customers, so we wanted to focus more on 
                    implementing certain features that enable users to have the true experience of having a virtual unified 
                    wallet.
